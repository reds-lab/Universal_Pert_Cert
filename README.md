# Universal_Pert_Cert
This repo is the official implementation of the ICLR'23 paper "Towards Robustness Certification Against Universal Perturbations." We calculate the certified robustness against universal perturbations (UAP/ Backdoor) given a trained model.


The code implements linear bounds calculated using the existing method (we load auto_LiRPA as an example) to extend linear bounds to compute the certified UP robustness for a batch of data. This repository aims to provide an accessible tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of robustness certification and machine learning security w.r.t. universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) and $l_{\infty}$-norm bounded backdoors.
